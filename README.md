# 🧠 BiasBreakers – Multilingual Meme Classification

🚀 Official implementation of the BiasBreakers framework
📚 Developed for the LT-EDI 2026 Shared Task on Homophobic and Transphobic Meme Detection

This repository contains the implementation of BiasBreakers, a multimodal meme classification framework designed to detect homophobic and transphobic content across English, Hindi, and Chinese memes.

The system integrates OCR extraction, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), CLIP-based multimodal embeddings, and transformer classifiers to effectively capture the interaction between visual and textual cues in memes.

## 📌 Project Overview

Memes are inherently multimodal, combining images, embedded text, sarcasm, and contextual signals. Detecting harmful intent in memes is challenging because the hate may arise from the interaction between visual content and textual components.

To address this challenge, our system combines:

🖼 Visual Understanding using pretrained vision encoders

📝 OCR-based Text Extraction from meme images

🤖 Vision-Language Models for semantic understanding

🔗 Multimodal Feature Fusion

🌍 Multilingual Processing for English, Hindi, and Chinese

This allows the framework to perform robust harmful meme detection across multiple languages.
🏆 Shared Task

This work was developed for the LT-EDI 2026 Shared Task on Detecting Homophobia and Transphobia in Memes.

📄 Task Link {https://www.codabench.org/competitions/11335/}

The goal of the task is to classify memes into:

Homophobic

Transphobic

Non Anti-LGBT

using both image and textual information.

## ⚙️ Pipeline Architecture

The framework follows a **multimodal classification pipeline**:

1️⃣ **OCR Extraction**  
Text is extracted from meme images using OCR.

2️⃣ **Vision-Language Processing**  
Images and extracted text are processed using **Qwen-VL models**.

3️⃣ **Multimodal Feature Fusion**  
Visual and textual features are combined.

4️⃣ **Meme Classification**  
Final classification is performed on fused representations.
